We are playing a game for the brainstorming part of the workshop where we draw on Hamilton's 7 powers. 

The game has 4 different types of cards: 

- power cards (Scale economics, Network economics, counter-positioning, switching costs, branding, cornered resource, process power)
- stakeholder cards (airport, travel agencies, strategic partnerships, the passenger, businesses)
- strategic objectives cards (growth, sustainable, Self-service, digital)
- competitor cards (valet, parking garage, public transport, shuttle, ride sharing).

When it's a players turn, they will draw at least one card of each type and then come up with a strategy.

For example, I draw:
- Power: process power
- Stakeholder card: the airport
- Objective: digital
- Competitor: airport parking garage

My answer:

## Strategy
I propose we integrate with the airports booking site so customers can book our service directly.

## Time Horizon
Medium Term

## Explanation
 By allowing customers to book directly from the official airport website, we help streamline the experience and also allow the airport to collect more data.

Now it's your turn to play the game.

Draw 4 random cards, then use those cards to come up with a strategy along with an explanation.
